# Python Challenge

## Project Background

### **Background**
In this challenge, you'll complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

**PyBank**

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- 
**PyPoll**

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hill’s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
************PyBank************
- The Resources folder contains only one file, budget_data.csv - contains two columns with data about the date and the profit/losses of that day.
- The analysis folder contains only one file, financial_analysis.txt - a text file with the answer to each question asked printed in it.
- main.py - contains the code used to analyze the data, answer project questions, and print the financial_analysis.txt file to the analysis folder.
************PyPoll************
- The Resources folder contains only one file, election_data.csv - contains three columns with data on the Ballot ID of the voter, County the voter is in, and Candidate the voter voted for.
- The analysis folder contains only one file, election_resuslts.txt - a text file with the answer to each question asked printed in it.
- main.py - contains the code used to analyze the data, answer project questions, and print the election_results.txt file to the analysis folder.
